        <p>
          We welcome donations of any amount. As the person making the donation
          you can make it a general donation or you can direct the money to be
          spent in a specific way. An example is making a monetary donation that
          is ear marked for crates.

        <h3 class="text-red">In Memoriam</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes people like to make a donation in the name of a beloved pet
          who has passed away. Other times people make a donation in the name of
          a family member or friend who was an animal lover. We gratefully
          accept both forms of donation.

        <p>
          We are happy to receive monthly, bi-monthly, annual or semi-annual
          donations of any amount. Some people chose to make a donation on every
          family memberâ€™s birthday, or on certain holidays, we are happy to
          accept any donations that you and your family would like to make.
